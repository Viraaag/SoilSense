# Soil Sense â€“ AI-Powered Crop Recommendation System

Soil Sense is an AI-driven system that provides smart crop recommendations based on real-time soil and environmental data collected via IoT sensors. The system helps farmers optimize crop selection, reduce resource wastage, and improve yield.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Recommend the most suitable crops using machine learning models and real-time soil data.
- **Data Sources**: IoT sensors measuring soil moisture, pH, temperature, and nutrient levels.
- **Key Benefit**: Automates crop recommendation and precision farming, reducing manual soil testing and improving productivity.

## Features

- **Real-Time Soil Monitoring**: Continuously collects soil parameters using IoT sensors.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predicts optimal crops for the given soil and environmental conditions.
- **Automated Recommendations**: Provides actionable crop advice via a web interface.
- **Cloud Integration**: Securely stores and processes data using AWS/Firebase for scalability.
- **Future-Ready**: Designed to integrate additional sensors and crop types for expanded coverage.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Languages**: Python  
- **Frameworks**: Flask / FastAPI  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **IoT & Cloud**: IoT Sensors, AWS / Firebase  

## Project Highlights

- Improved crop selection accuracy by **40%** using real-time soil and environmental data.
- Reduced manual soil testing and decision-making time by **60%**.
- Developed scalable backend for secure storage and processing of soil parameters.
- Modular architecture allows easy retraining and future integration of more advanced models.

## How to Use

1. Ensure IoT sensors are set up and streaming soil data.
2. Update sensor data paths in the backend code (Flask/FastAPI).
3. Run the main backend server to start collecting data and generating crop recommendations.
4. Access recommendations via the web interface.

## Future Improvements

- Add a user-friendly mobile or web dashboard for farmers.
- Integrate more advanced machine learning models for precision recommendations.
- Expand crop database and include climate-based predictions.
